            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Brief DISCOURSE Concerning PRINTING AND PRINTERS.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <p>NOt to inſiſt here, upon the time when, place where, and manner how <hi>Printing</hi> was invented; let it ſuffice to ſpeak of the time of its bringing hither, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment it had here, the progreſs it made, the abuſes it hath ſuffered, and the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (under favour) it ought to have among us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Stow</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> p. 404. tells us, that it was brought into <hi>England</hi> by one <hi>William Caxton</hi> a Mercer of <hi>London, circa Anno Dom.</hi> 1471. which was the eleventh year of the Reign of <hi>Edward the fourth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hither being come, you may judge how the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48130:3"/>of that Age eſteemed it, by the reception they gave it; not permitting it to take up its abode in common and ordinary houſes, but receiving it into their Monaſteries, as if they intended to make it a part of their own ſtudies; which it ſeems they did for ſome time, it being practiſed not onely in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but in that of S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> S. <hi>Albans,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Thus it continued thirteen years, or thereabout, without any conſiderable improvement, as to <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> And therefore (that ſuch a Talent might no longer lie hidden as it were in a Napkin, but be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for common good) in the firſt year of King <hi>Richard the third,</hi> in an Act of Parliament made (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things) for reſtraint of Aliens from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any Handy-crafts here (except as ſervants to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) a ſpecial Proviſo was inſerted, That ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers might bring Printed or Written Books to ſell at their pleaſure, and exerciſe the Art of Printing here, any thing in that Act to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and this done (as is intimated in the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Act of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for repealing the ſaid Proviſo) not onely that the Kingdom might not want the benefit of ſo excellent an Invention, but that the Natives might thereby gain an inſight into the ſame.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> proving good proficients, in the ſpace of thirty years they were grown ſo numerous, as to furniſh the Kingdom with Books; and ſo skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as to Print them as well as any beyond the Seas; as is atteſted by the ſaid Act of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogates the ſaid Proviſo for that reaſon. And, the better to encourage and ſecure the Native Printers in the exerciſe of their new-acquired Faculty (as alſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48130:3"/>the Book Binders) it was in the ſaid Statute further Enacted, that if any perſon bought forreign Books bound, he ſhould pay 6 <hi>s.</hi> — 8 <hi>d.</hi> per Book for every Book ſo bought: the like for any that bought any Printed Books of ſtrangers, except in groſs: with a Proviſo againſt the inhanſing the prices of Books, as in that Statute at large appears.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that Printing was received into the Church in its infancie in this Nation; where having been nurſed till it could creep abroad, the King and State took care of it when abroad: uſing ſtrangers as Crutches to ſupport it when weak, and ſecuring it when ſtrengthned, from being beaten with the ſame.</p>
               <p>Printing being thus improved, and ſecured from forrein invaſion, it continued for many years in the hands of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> at large. But afterwards, in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> years of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated together with Stationers, or Book-ſellers, by the name of <hi>The Company of Stationers.</hi> Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and concorporation, although it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt made in favour of Printers, and for their encouragement and ſecurity (after the example of former Kings, as before is ſhewen) yet, where inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and prejudice ſwayes not, it will be judged ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtructive and miſchievous then otherwiſe, by any that underſtand the caſe; at leaſt, if perhaps it might conduce to their well-being then, when the Book-ſellers were very few, and as inconſiderable, and ſo the Printers ſufficient to hold the balance even, yea, to turn the ſcale with them; yet, the caſe being now much altered, the conſtitution ought alſo to be changed: and Printers being (as aforeſaid) freed from the intruſions of forrein Nations, ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48130:4"/>not, in reaſon, be enſlaved by the encroachments of Natives, nor ſuffer that which was intended for their benefit, to turn to their deſtruction; and ſo loſe the fruition of the good deſigned by the ſeveral Lawes made in their favour, and without doubt intended by that Charter.</p>
               <p>I ſay, now the caſe is altered: for whereas when the Grant was made, Book-ſellers were very few, (as indeed they have been within mans memory) and thoſe few not conſiderable (nor could they, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that all antient Books of worth were Printers Copies) now they are multiplied exceedingly (how much in ſo long a time, we may gheſs by what we have ſeen in our ſhort time:) and whereas at firſt they were but as an Appendix to the Printers, and (as cyphers) ſtood but to make up a number; now they are grown ſo bulkie and numerous (together with many of ſeveral other Trades that they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in) and ſo conſiderable withal, (being much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by Printers impoveriſhment, and chiefly built upon their ruines) that there is hardly one Printer to ten others that have a ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Company; and thoſe that have, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dare not ſtand for the Intereſt of Printing, for fear of loſing a Work-Maſter; or will not, becauſe they have an intereſt among them; or if they do, it ſignifies nothing, in ſuch a diſparity of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>But they may object, why ſhould you envy our proſperity, or grudge at our growth? why did ye not look better to your ſelves, and keep what ye had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?</p>
               <p>To this objection Printers may anſwer, That though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48130:4"/>they ought not to envy or grudge at the proſperity of others, (no, not of the wicked) yet they ought not to neglect their own, nor ſuffer themſelves to be troden down by the inſolence of others. And as for look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves, they might have done it, had they been by themſelves: but being yok'd to the Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and having no other ſupport but their authority, it hath proved a broken ſtaff, and like the reed of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which whilſt Printers have leaned upon, it hath pierced them thorow. For when other Artificers could retain their freedom, and enjoy their immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, notwithſtanding the confuſions of the late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly times, the Printers were the onely men lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to irregularities among themſelves, and uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intruſions from others; while the Stationers (who have got the Rule by ſuch means as aforeſaid) either would not or could not afford any redreſs, or uſe means to repreſs or prevent any diſorder: (yet never failed to exact their accuſtomed pretended dues from all ſuch their members, to the utmoſt.) Yea, ſo far were they from redreſſing the Printers wrongs, or vindicating their rights, that ſome of themſelves took upon themſelves the exerciſe of their function, and as if that had not been enough, one that was a forreiner, having no relation to this or any other trade, had a freedom given him <hi>gratis,</hi> to enable him to uſurp the exerciſe of the Printers calling. And at laſt, to compleat the abuſe, and to encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the like, they erect a Printing-houſe by a joynt ſtock of their own, and call it, <hi>The Companies Houſe;</hi> wherein (for ſeveral years) they rob'd the lawful Printers of as much of their employment as would have maintained many of their families. Which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48130:5"/>example of theirs, was after followed by a perſon as extraneous, by the erection of another Printing houſe; which although it were to a noble end, was no leſs ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and injurious to Printers: whom yet Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot blame, ſince all their fences being tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down, even by ſuch as ought to have upheld and repaired them, no marvel if ſtrangers miſtook their Paſture for a Common. Yea, by theſe means their whole tribe were grown to ſuch a height of inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that if a Printer preſumed to contend with them about the price of work, and would not take their rates, the meaneſt of them would menace him with having a Printing-houſe of his own.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with Printers; and being thus, no marvel they are reduced to ſuch a paſs as they are. For whereas formerly (even in the laſt age) they were Aldermens fellows, and lived above the temptations of a neceſſitous condition; now (except one or two of the old ſtock, and a few others that raiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the late times) they are ſo far from having conſiderable eſtates, that they can hardly ſubſiſt in credit to maintain their families. Neither can it be otherwiſe, when they that ſhould have upheld them, have not onely ſuffered them to fall, yea thus pulled them down with both their hands; but leſt they ſhould riſe again, continue by all means to keep them down, in the abridging of their prices, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of their payments.</p>
               <p>And thus come Printers to be chous'd (as they call their over-reaching one another) of all the moſt conſiderable Copies: for ſince theſe diſorders, when an ancient Maſter-Printer died, and his Copies were expoſed to ſale, few or none of the young ones were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48130:5"/>of ability to deal for them, nor indeed for any other. So that the Bookſellers having engros'd almoſt all, it is become a queſtion among them, whether a Printer ought to have any Copy or no: or if he have, they (keeping the Regiſter) will hardly enter it; or if they do, they and their accomplices will uſe all means to diſparage it, if not down-right counterfeit it.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid (as they commonly do) that they had not power to prevent or redreſs the irregularities of Printing, or to keep out intruders; it may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That they had power (if they had not wanted ſomething elſe) not to have done that themſelves, which they could not help in others. But had they not power? how then could they demand or expect obedience? If Protection and Subjection are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal, they that cannot afford the one, ought not to exact the other.</p>
               <p>But they may ſay what they will, we ſee and feel what they have done. And now I leave it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all unintereſted perſons, whether thoſe that for the time paſt have thus improved their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of tyrannizing over Printers, ought to have the Government of them for the future, when the like opportunity cannot be wanting, as the conſtitution now is, they having gotten the ſtart of them both as to number and eſtates. Yea, as to number, they may if they pleaſe ſtill increaſe <hi>adinfinitum;</hi> which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot, but muſt lie under a reſtraint in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: which is no ſmall argument of the abſurdity and unnaturalneſs of their Concorporation; ſince in all ſound Bodies, the natural growth is in all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers proportionable; and where it is otherwiſe, it is eſteemed monſtrous.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48130:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But more particularly: there are two things that render any man or men uncapable of truſt or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Ignorance in the thing entruſted.</item>
                  <item>2. A contrary intereſt thereunto.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That the Stationers or Bookſellers are incapable of the Rule of Printers upon both theſe accounts, is not hard to evince.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: They muſt needs be ignorant of Printing, becauſe never inſtructed in it, or brought up to it. For the manifold myſteries of that exquiſite Art are not ſo eaſily diſcovered, or ſo quickly made practicable, but that the time of an Apprentiſhip is little enough for the acquiſition of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And this want of knowledge in the Art, incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites them to govern the Artiſts, upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſince a more then ordinary inſpection ought to be made into it, for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Art it ſelf is more then ordinarily curious, inſomuch that many of thoſe that have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Apprentiſhips to it, and ſpent many years in the practice of it, are yet to ſeek in the moſt material re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of a good workman. But if we grant it to be but ordinary, ſurely it is not ſo mean, as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of that priviledge which all other Societies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; witneſs the cuſtom of <hi>London.</hi> But it is abſurd and ridiculous for any to have the rule or overſight of that which they have no inſight in: as well may a blinde man judge of colours, or a deaf man of ſounds. A controverſie may ariſe betwixt Artiſt and Artiſt, which referr'd to thoſe that govern, might prevent vexatious Law-ſuits; but if the Governours under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the thing in difference, how can they decide the controverſie?</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48130:6"/>
               <p n="2">2. Printing requires a more then ordinary inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe of the great influence it hath upon the Publike peace and ſafety, which is very much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by its irregularity, and which ought by all means poſſible to be preſerved. Now by how much the more evil or danger there is in the miſcarriage of a buſineſs, ſo much more care ought to be had in the management of that buſineſs: and the not due inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Printing being of ſuch dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſurely it ought to be committed to them that have the moſt perfect underſtanding thereof, and not to thoſe that can pretend to no knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>But to ſalve this, they ſay, We take Printers with us when we go to ſearch; (whereby (by the way) they acknowledge their own inſufficiencie.)</p>
               <p>That frequent and diligent ſearching and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking of Printing-houſes, is the onely way to keep Printing in order, I think cannot be denied. And ſince this cannot be done without Printers, why ſhould not they onely be entruſted therewith? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in matters of great truſt, it is not enough that a perſon skilled in the affairs entruſted, be employed therein; that perſon muſt alſo receive ſuitable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encouragement in the diſcharge of his truſt, or it may juſtly be feared his faithfulneſs will ſoon fail: and therefore the Law and Cuſtom hath made proviſion in all like caſes, to cut off ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to remove ſuch temptations, the better to ſecure the end of the truſt. And is the great truſt of the overſight of the Preſs like to be well diſcharged, when they that are onely capable thereof muſt have no hand therein, but at the appointment of ſuch
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48130:7"/>whoſe intereſt it is to keep both Printing and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in confuſion and diſorder? All men naturally as free Agents propound ſome benefit to ariſe from all their actions, which is the motive to their thorow and ready performance of ſuch actions. But when they can propound no ſuch end to themſelves, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do not act at all, or no further then they are forced; eſpecially if it be ſo far from procuring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, that it brings miſchief with it: as in our caſe, ſhould Printers (as now conſtituted) uſe their utmoſt skill and care in diſcovering the abuſes of the Preſs, the Stationers would have the credit and honour of it, and be reckoned the onely loyal and induſtrious men; and thereupon get new priviledges, together with the confirmation of their old; and the Printers ſo far from being benefited by it, that it would onely the better enable the Stationers to keep them under.</p>
               <p>And truly the caſe being thus, here is not onely a temptation, but a ground for Printers (ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being natural) to do the work either not at all, or but by halfs.</p>
               <p>But to this it may be ſaid, They may employ ſome certain Printer, giving him good encouragment, either to accompany them in their ſearches, or to go alone.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: This were mercenary, and here would be place for bribing; and he that ſees largeſt, ſhould be the moſt ſpared, or the oftneſt have pre-intelligence of ſearches, to evade them. And this would be far enough from anſwering the end of Regulation.</p>
               <p>But then it may be objected, If ye would have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stationers, nor Stationers and Printer, nor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone, who ſhould be employed in the over-ſight of Printing?</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48130:7"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I would have the over-ſight of Printing committed to Printers onely; and not onely ſo, but to Printers as Printers, and not to Printers as Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>Two reaſons enforce this: the firſt reſpecting the prevention of Printing ſcandalous and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Books; the other regarding the better Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all Books.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, it hath been ſhewed already how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual it is for any other but Artiſts to take the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of Printing, and how eaſily the inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſtrangers may be eluded by any that have a minde to make a ſiniſter uſe of that Art; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how little better it is to call Printers to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of others, ſince they are like to be but cold in their ſcrutiny, when their diſcoveries ſhall redound nothing to their own profit or reputation, but to the advantage of thoſe that call them, whoſe hands will be thereby the more ſtrengthned againſt them. It hath been ſhewed alſo how much leſs available it will be to employ a Mercenary in the caſe. So that Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God, and Treaſon againſt the King; Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Hereſie in the Church, and Faction and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the State, may ſtill be (as it is and hath been) broached and fomented by the Preſs, for any thing to the contrary can be done by the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, wherein they that onely have the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have neither authority nor encouragement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and prevent ſuch abuſes; I mean, the Printers, who were they encouraged, as they are onely able, ſo they would be engaged both in Honour and Intereſt to be faithful in the diſcharge thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48130:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p n="1">1. In honour: it would free them from the many clamours that lie againſt them. For at the firſt ſight of any thing in print that is offenſive, who is cryed out upon but the Printer, yea, all Printers, as if they were the moſt wretched of men! So that it is almoſt a ſhame to own that moſt noble Profeſſion. Whereas indeed (as now) Printers are not Printers; that is, they have no power as a Society to rectifie diſorders in Printing; and ſo bear the blame of that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help. Beſides, ſuch enormities are generally committed by ſuch as have irregularly crept into the exerciſe of the Art, in the want of a due eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: neither do ſuch tranſgreſſors ever want en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers to begin, or chapmen to vend ſuch ware when finiſhed, among the Stationers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It would be for the intereſt of Printers to keep their Faculty in due order, ſince it would both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their damage, and procure them again: both which concern Printers in this caſe.</p>

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. It would procure the gain of the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (which <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us what it is<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 10.35 16.15.10.12.</note>) whereby it is hoped ſuch further priviledges and immunities might be obtained, as might ſet both Art and Artiſts above that diſdain and contumely under which it and they are now ſubjected; ſo that of contemptible, it may become honourable; of deſpicable, deſirable; and ſuch as are free of it, may be free indeed, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48130:8"/>not manumitted (as of late) from the ſervice of one Maſter, to the ſlavery of many Tyrants.</p>
                  </div>
               </div>
               <div type="section_continued">
                  <p>For, if Stationers have obtained ſo many and great favours upon the account of Printing (which yet they have not in any meaſure been able to manage to the promoting of the Kings intereſt) much more ſhall the Artiſts themſelves finde favour with his Majeſty, when they ſhall be in a capacity to give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their abilities, uſefulneſs and diligence in that ſervice, and the preſervation of the peace of the Kingdom, wherein the well management of their Art is ſo much concerned.</p>
                  <p>Again, as it is the onely effectual way for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or diſcovery of evil and miſchievous Books; ſo alſo to procure the well doing of all Books. There is a clamour (and that not unjuſtly) againſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Printing, becauſe we Print not ſo well here as they beyond the Seas. Many reaſons are aſſign'd. Some fault the Paper, and ſome the Ink; ſome ſay it is in the Water, others in the Letter; and a third ſort, in the Workmen: but it ſeems to be taken for granted by all, to be impoſſible to Print here ſo well as there; whereas the defect is not neceſſary, but accidental. It is granted, that the generality of our Printing falls ſhort of theirs beyond Sea. But that it muſt neceſſarily do ſo, I deny; foraſmuch as ſome of our Printing at this day equals theirs; and the generality came not ſhort of them in former times, even in the infancie of Printing in <hi>England,</hi> as is witneſſed by that Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. So that the fault lies not in the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged, but in ſomething elſe, even in the want of encouragement, and due looking to. For, thoſe that eſcaped ruine by our diſorders, and are in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48130:9"/>to undertake generous deſigns in Printing, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them on as credibly and as gracefully now, as any beyond Sea; and ſo might the reſt, were they in the like condition. But the Stationers having uſurped our Calling, and encouraged, yea hired others ſo to do, and thereby encreaſed our number beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and conſequently brought our rates ſo low, as not to afford good Materials, or engage good Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; hence comes Printing to be at this paſs. Which they regard not; for the moſt of them little regard how ill their work be done, ſo it be cheap done.</p>
                  <p>Now as a due eſtabliſhment of Printers upon a right ground would put them in a better capacity of obtaining Materials and ſuitable requiſites for their Calling: ſo would it enable thoſe to whom the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight ſhould fall, from time to time, to look after ſuch as are ignorant, careleſs, or negligent in the duties of their Calling.</p>
                  <p>Thus having ſhewed the Stationers ignorance in Printing, and conſequently their incapacity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight thereof: let us now conſider their intereſt; and if that be found to oppoſe the good both of Printing and Printers, I think there needs no other Argument (had we no more) to prove them unfit to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the caſe. I might inſtance in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars wherein the Intereſt of Stationers (I mean Bookſellers, who are the moſt conſiderable, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended here) oppoſes that of Printers: yea, it is hard to inſtance in one particular wherein their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts agree. But this one conſideration may ſuffice, That they ſtand related to each other, as the Buyer to the Seller: and as reaſonably (in my judgement)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48130:9"/>may the Buyer have the Rule of the Seller, as the Book-ſeller govern the Printer.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it be reaſonably ſaid to be an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humour or affectation in Printers, to deſire their own Rule and Government, any more then it may be ſaid to be pride in a Houſholder to deſire the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his own houſhold; or ambition in one that hath ſerved his Apprentiſhip, to deſire his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Indeed, did they aim at domineering over others, whoſe perſons are out of their juriſdiction, and whoſe affairs are above their underſtanding, this were reprovable: and yet this is the great deſign of the Stationers, in reference to Printers; and they take it for great preſumption in the Printers, to go about to oppoſe their deſign, in procuring their own freedom; calling it breach of Oath: as if becauſe of our Oath, we muſt lie down under all their abuſes and oppreſſions without ſeeking redreſs; wherein yet we take not upon us to be our own Judges, but refer our cauſe to the ſame power that gave them theirs, who may reſume or abridge the ſame upon miſuſer, at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it was urged once before the Lords, that Printers were the Mechanick part of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo unfit to rule; let the import of the word be conſidered, and it will be found to bear no ſuch ſlight ſignification as that Gentleman was pleaſed to put upon it. For beſides that a conſiderable branch of the noble Science Mathematical (<hi>viz,</hi> the Art of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great weights) goes under that denomination; if it be taken for Manual Arts, or handy-Crafts, yet it is to be underſtood of ſuch as require ingenuity

                  <p>But let them be ſuppoſed to be Mechanicks in his ſenſe, that is, ſuch as are below the grandeur of Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers; muſt they not therefore have the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own Affairs? hath not the meaneſt Subject as great a command in his own Family and Affairs, as the greateſt Lord in his? But the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman miſs-put the caſe, as if the Printers aimed at the Rule of the Stationers; whereas they onely aim at their own freedom, and the reaping the like fruits of their ſervitude with other their fellow-Subjects and Citizens.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhould Mechanicks or Handy-Crafts be ſo lightly eſteemed, when the Law hath ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for them, and makes ſo manifold Proviſion for their improvement, and the encouragement of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactors; witneſs the many Statutes about the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Norwich,</hi> more concerning Clothiers: an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Decree about Cordwayners, and many Statutes thereupon: Barbers and Chirurgeons united, for mutual benefit: Clothiers to be overſeen by the Lord Maior, and incorporated: Brewers and Sope-makers not to make their own Barrels, but the Coopers: Plaiſterer and Painter not to intrench upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor Carpenter and Joyner. Indeed, it were endleſs to enumerate the Statutes and Decrees made in favour of Manufactors, to protect them from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and abuſes; to which end the meaneſt have been put into diſtinct aſſociations, and impowred to make by Lawes for their better ſubſiſtence. And for the encouragement of them all, there is a clauſe in the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> prohibiting any to uſe a Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Craft,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48130:10"/>that hath not ſerved ſeven years Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip to it.</p>
                  <p>Neither was this care taken of them without good reaſon, ſince they are eſſentially neceſſary, whereas Shop-keepers are but accidental, like ſuckers ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the root of the former. For without the Clothier, where were the Draper? without the Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, where were the Haberdaſher? and without the Printer, where were the Book-ſeller? Yea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Clothier, what need (neceſſarily) is there of the Draper? having the Hat-maker, what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Haberdaſher? and having the Printer, no fear of wanting Books, though there were no Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller.</p>
                  <p>But it may be alleadged, that the preſent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is ancient, and therefore not to be altered.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: If evil, the older the worſe: neither are there examples wanting of the change or ſuppreſſion of more ancient Conſtitutions then this, when once they have proved injurious or uſeleſs. Nor is this the firſt time the preſent Conſtitution of Printers hath been complained of as a grievance: for our forefathers (many years ſince, even when Printers had not experimented a tythe of what they now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) did the like in their time, as appears by ſome of their Papers yet extant, and the teſtimony of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſtill living.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we want not examples (both former and later) of the diviſion or ſeparation of one part of a Company from the other, when their conjunction hath been found inconvenient or injurious.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48130:11"/>may be printed by one man in one day, as could be written by many in a whole year; or, as <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> as much as the readieſt Pen-man could well diſpatch in two years.

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48130:13"/>
               <p>Indeed, it were endleſs to repeat what hath been written by learned men in praiſe of this noble Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there having been whole Treatiſes of the ſame. I ſhall onely add a word or two.</p>
               <p>How grateful to the world was the invention of Letters, when they were no otherwiſe to be made le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible but upon Pillars, and Bark of Trees? but how much more, when the uſe of Parchment was found out, and after, that of Paper, with the uſe of the Pen to write thereupon? And yet that compared to this, is but as a Ruſh-candle to a Torch; but as a Candle under a Buſhel, to one upon a Candleſtick. For Printing is as it were the Firmament, in whoſe Expanſion all the Luminaries of Learning and Art are made viſible to all above the Horizon of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Yea, Printing puts Books into every mans hand, whereby though we cannot practiſe all things, we may try all things. Now the Divine cannot pin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Faith upon his ſleeve, and lead him implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Bible is at hand, whereby a man may try whether what he ſaith be ſo or no. Nor can the Lawyer deviate in a cauſe, but he may be diſcerned by a quick eye, by reaſon of that light which ſhines round about us in Books of that Faculty. Neither can the Phyſitian preſcribe at random, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcover'd by the ſame means.</p>
               <p>And whereas formerly the common people were entertained with feigned Traditions of the Legenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in ſtead of thoſe Divine Oracles of the Old and New Teſtament; and with like fabulous ſtories of Giants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſtead of real Hiſtories: now they have not onely the Bible, but Expoſitions thereof,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48130:13"/>bringing it to their capacities, for their ſpiritual uſe and comfort; and the civil tranſactions of former times lively repreſented, whereby they may imitate the good, and ſhun the evil, and furniſh themſelves with Notions and Diſcourſes ſutable to rational Creatures. And all this by the benefit of Printing.</p>
               <p>Yea, by this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath received ſuch a wound, as ſhe will never be able to cure: for upon its diſcovery, ſuch a light hath broken forth, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kingdoms and Countries that formerly had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glimpſe but what proceeded from her Dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, have hence received ſo great Illumination, that they finde juſt occaſion to forſake her, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her pretended Infallibility.</p>
               <p>By this alſo our modern Pretenders of new lights, are diſcovered to be onely Revivers of old Errours; we having hereby the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories of all former Ages, wherein we finde the Founders of thoſe Follies and Impieties wherein theſe ape them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, having given you the opinions of the Learned concerning Printing and Printers, let us wade a little into the diſcovery of the uſage both it and they finde in other Countries. How it fares with them in <hi>France,</hi> the Stationers themſelves inform us, in a Paper called, <hi>The humble Remonſtrance of the Company of Stationers,</hi> ſigned by one <hi>Henry Parker</hi> Eſq; who ſaith, That <hi>France eſpecially favours that Profeſsion and Trade of men,</hi> (meaning Printers;) <hi>for there they are above Mechanicks, and live in the Suburbs of Learning.</hi> And a little before, ſpeaking of <hi>Europe: The more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a place is, the more regard it hath to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> Whence he proceeds to commend the Papiſts, as well where the Inquiſition is not, as where it is, for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48130:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>their ſtrict Regulation of Printing, whereby their Church is better fortified, and the Artiſts more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged then ours. Nor are Printers without extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary priviledges in moſt tranſmarine parts, as in <hi>Italy, France, Spain, &amp;c.</hi> where (as if they were Church-men) they are exempted from thoſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Taxes and Duties whereunto the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are liable. Nay, ſo great a reſpect have the Kings of <hi>France</hi> for this Art, that for many years they have maintained the practice of it in their own Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> allowing the Artiſts a ſubſiſtence ſutable to their eminent place, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous employment: and in <hi>Spain</hi> it is moſtly exerciſed in Monaſteries and Religious Houſes to this day, as it was here at its firſt arrival among us, as we have ſhewn in the beginning.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be forgotten, that thoſe two great Monarchs, the one of <hi>France,</hi> the other of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conceive themſelves not ſufficiently illuſtrious, unleſs they had eminently concerned themſelves in the encouragement of this Art; and therefore they took upon them the Patronage of thoſe famous Bibles in ſeveral Oriental Tongues, which paſs under their great Names to this day.</p>
